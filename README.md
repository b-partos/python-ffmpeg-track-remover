# Description
A small python script that uses the ffmpeg libraries to remove audio tracks from video files in an automated manner.

# Dependencies
The script requires the [ffmpeg libraries](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html) to be downloaded. 
The location of the folder is added as a parameter, see the script docstring.

# Use
The script still contains scenario specific comments and is not completely generic.

The script invokes external programs via python subprocess.

It has not been tested on any system or computer different from where it was made.
